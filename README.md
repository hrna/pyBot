#An IRC Bot Written in Python

* **pyBot Requirements:**
  * **Python 3.2 or higher**
  * **BeautifulSoup 4**
  * **Lxml or html5lib**
  * **python-dateutil**
  * **pystemmer (for Cobe)**
  
* **In a case where you dont have the system administrators 
  rights you may use easy install for these plugins
  for example:**
  * `easy_install3 --user pystemmer`
  * `easy_install3 --user python-dateutil`


**Running the bot**
--

* **Unpack the source code to the destination of your choice**
  * Modify the `config.py` file meeting your needs
  * Run the bot with command `./pyBot.py`
  
**Something about modules**
--

* Some of the modules (the most of them) are designed to meet our own needs (as we use the bot as well), so in some cases the language might be in finnish `modules/fmi.py` like in this particular case.
* Cobe plugin is written in `python 2.x` but we have modified it to run smoothly also on `python 3.x`

**About the pyBot project**
--

* **Feel free to dig in the code, use the bot, write your own modules as you desire or get in touch with us if you want to contribute to this project**
* **Now as im writing this, we are about to launch `pyBot version 1.0` and planning to continue the development further forward. Our goal is to improve our skills related to python and over all coding :)**
