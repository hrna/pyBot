for 0.3.0
  - clean up the modules I've created from useless crap and prints
  - modify logger, use seendb.txt for every user's latest msg with timestamp
  - use that seendb.txt for seen module
  - seendb in logger_daemon has a bad flaw, infinite flooding loop eating out the diskspace, also needed checkups 
	for temp.txt if file exists or not
